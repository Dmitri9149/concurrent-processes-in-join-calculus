The JoCaml language is used here for implementation of many parallel and distributed constructs. The work is based on the tutorial : http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html

The JoCaml is originated from join calculus. In some way the calculus is an alternative to lambda calculus. The JoCaml is implemented as an extension of OCaml. The JoCaml is very good for paralled and distributed multiagent computations. It is typed functional programming language. 
The expressive power of the language is quite high and the programm code is quite short. 

The best way to install JoCaml is from source tarball. Follow instructions on the http://jocaml.inria.fr/

In the future I plan to use the language and the constructs as semantics for molecular cell 
processes like intercellular interactions, virus - cell interaction, cell differentiation and proliferation.
