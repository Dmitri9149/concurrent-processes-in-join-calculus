The JoCaml language is used here for implementation of many parallel and distributed constructs. The work is based on the tutorial : http://jocaml.inria.fr/doc/index.html

The JoCaml is originated from join calculus : a process calculus which is in some way an alternative to lambda calculus. The JoCaml is implemented as an extension of OCaml. The JoCaml is very good for paralled and distributed multiagent computations. It is typed and functional programming language.
